<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Currently I am an undergraduate student in the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University.
    I major in computer science, and minor in mathematics.<br /></p>
<p>My research interests are situated in quantum computing and quantum information. More precisely, I am interested in investigating structure 
of problems, and applying techniques from TCS (such as complexity theory) and math (such as representation theory) to solve problems 
in quantum computing. I have been doing research on quantum alogorithm for algebraic problems, such as supersingular isogeny problem 
(the intractability of which has been the basis of a post-quantum crypto protocol SIKE.) and hidden subgroup problem (HSP). I am also interested in 
using theory in math and physics (such as category theory) to develop and discribe theories in quantum computing.   </p>

<h4>
    B.S, <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University (PKU)</a> [2019.9 ~ 2023.6]

<h2>Publications</h2>
Expecting one!
<h2>Research Experiences</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p> Quantum Algorithms For Supersingular Isogeny Problem. <a href="pdf/isogeny.pdf"> [pdf] </a> 
    with Boyang Chen, Han Luo, advised by <a href="https://www.tongyangli.com/">Tongyang Li.</a> </p>
    <p>We made some attempts to improve existing algorithms for the supersingular isogeny problem using techniques in quantum walk,
         but failed due to the special structure of the problem. I wrote a survey about this problem, pointed out the hardness of the 
         problem and explained why we failed.

    <li>
        Seminar on Physics and Computing [2022 Winter]<br />
        <p>
            I am going to hold a seminar on physics and computing, discussing the relationship between them.
